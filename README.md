User Story 1 (MVP):
I want to know which Halloween events are happening in the Portland area. I can use the events page to see a listing of events. I can click on an event title to open a detail page with more information about the event.

User Story 2 (MVP Pt. 2):
In addition to User Story 1, I want to be able to suggest events and save a wishlist of events. I can sign up and log in using a magic link from Supabase. When I log in, I am taken to the events page. I am able to click "Add New Event" to reveal a form I can fill out to suggest a new event. On the detail page, I am also able to add the event to my wishlist. My header displays an additional "Wishlist" link I can click to view my wishlist at any time. On my wishlist page, I can delete items from my wishlist.

Additional features for future releases:
1. Map displaying event locations
2. Ability to filter events (e.g., free or paid; distance from home)
3. Ability to create and save multiple wishlists
4. Choice of avatar images
5. Ability to upload own avatar image
